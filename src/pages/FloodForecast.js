  <strong>Suicide Basin Monitoring:</strong> The US Geological Survey (USGS) utilizes time-lapse cameras to capture daily images, with an elevation scale bar to track water levels visually. Additionally, a laser range finder provides an independent and precise measurement of water elevation. However, floating icebergs can cause sudden fluctuations in readings, either raising or lowering recorded levels due to their varying heights.  
  <br /><br />
  <strong>Mendenhall Lake Monitoring:</strong> Water levels in Mendenhall Lake are continuously measured by the USGS at a point along the west shore of Mendenhall Lake. This real-time data helps assess flood potential by estimating the expected lake level if an outburst flood from Suicide Basin were to occur.

  <h2>Mendenhall Lake Level and Flood Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    Mendenhall Lake is a glacially-fed lake at the terminus of Mendenhall Glacier. Water levels fluctuate due to seasonal 
    melting, precipitation, and outburst floods. The USGS continuously monitors water levels along the lakeâ€™s west shore 
    to track these changes in real time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Water level in Mendenhall Lake is measured continuously (every 15 minutes) by the US Geological Survey. 
  The NWS uses forecasts or precipitation, glacier melt, and water release from Suicide Basin to forecast 
  the water level in Mendenhall Lake for 5 days from present (graph, above left). When the water level is forecasted to exceed the flood stage, a 
  flood watch or warning is issued.
  </p>
  <p>
    During outburst floods, lake levels can rise rapidly, posing a significant flood risk. For example, in August 2024, 
    the water level surged by over 10ft in just two days. Such extreme fluctuations highlight the importance of continuous monitoring 
    and early warnings.
  </p>
  <p>When the Mendenhall Lake water level exceeds 9 ft, flooding can occur in Mendenhall Valley. Flood stages for Mendenhall Lake range from minor
     (9-10 ft) to major (14+ ft) and are color coded to highlight known impacts documented by the National Weather Service (above, right).</p>

<div className="detail-card black-text">
  <h2>Understanding Flood Stages</h2>
  <p>
    Flood stages indicate the severity of flooding based on lake or river levels. These stages help 
    communities, emergency responders, and individuals assess potential risks and take necessary precautions. 
    The National Weather Service defines four primary flood categories: Action Stage, Minor, Moderate, and Major Flooding. The current flood stage and water level is shown above.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Action Stage (8 - 9ft):</strong> Water levels are elevated but remain below the minor flood threshold. This stage serves as an early warning to monitor conditions closely.</li>
    <li><strong>Minor Flooding (9ft - 10ft):</strong> Low-lying areas may experience some water coverage, causing minor road flooding or inconvenience. Typically, property damage is minimal.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderate Flooding (10ft - 14ft):</strong> Water begins inundating structures and roads near the river. Some evacuations might be necessary, and transportation disruptions are likely.</li>
    <li><strong>Major Flooding (14ft+):</strong> Extensive flooding with a significant risk to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Evacuations are often required, and severe damage may occur.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Monitoring flood stages allows for proactive flood management, enabling timely warnings and preparedness measures to protect lives and property.
