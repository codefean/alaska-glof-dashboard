            Confronting glacier outburst flood hazards to improve glacial flood
            forecasts across northwest North America
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our research focuses on understanding and predicting glacier outburst
            floods—sudden, powerful floods that occur when water trapped by
            glaciers is rapidly released. We combine field observations, satellite
            data, and advanced computer models to study how glaciers store and
            release water. This work helps us assess current and future flood
            hazards as glaciers retreat, identify locations most prone to glacial
            floods across Alaska and western British Columbia, and improve
            forecasting tools to protect communities and infrastructure. We work
            closely with federal and state partners to ensure that the models we
            develop directly support hazard preparedness and effective risk
            communication.
