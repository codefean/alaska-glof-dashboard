        The Alaska GLOF Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) events in Alaska. 
        This platform is designed to help researchers, emergency responders, and the public understand the risks associated with GLOFs and access critical data for decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dashboard includes data on glacial lakes, historical flood events, and (in the future) predictive models to forecast potential GLOF occurrences. 
        It serves as a valuable resource for monitoring glacial activity and assessing the impact of climate change on glacial systems.
