Ice Lake typically drains in late summer or fall after reaching a critical size, with drainage occurring over several days rather than catastrophically, resulting in gradual, multiday water-level increases downstream. Over recent decades, the lake has migrated downvalley due to thinning of the glacier dam, reflecting climate-driven glacier change. Although these outbursts are generally moderate, they pose hazards to recreational users such as sea kayakers and are important for understanding how climate warming influences glacier-dammed lakes and associated flood risks.",NA
